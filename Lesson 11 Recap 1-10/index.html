            <p>This is the body section of the blog post. It is where the main content goes.
                I am using <abbr title = "HyperMarkUpLenguage">HTML</abbr> because I am a
                beast programmer!</p>

            <p>This is <span class = "special-text">another paragraph</span>, and I would like to quote the late, great
                martin Luther King jr.,
                who once said <q>I have a dream</q></p>
            <blockquote cite = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream">
                <p>I still have a dream, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream â€“ one day<br>
                    this nation will rise up and live up to its creed, "We hold these truths to be self <br>
                    evident: that all men are created equal." I have a dream...</p>

                <p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later,
                    the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains
                    of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in
                    the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still
                    languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we
                    have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition. </p></blockquote>
